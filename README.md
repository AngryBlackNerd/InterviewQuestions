3. Read in a list of internet memes from a json file on the classpath (you choose the memes!).  Create one method which takes the list of memes and sorts them by name.  Create a second method which associates a "lulz" score (from 1-10) with each meme and writes the updated values to the same json file. 
4. Calculate the total cost of an item including tax based on whether it is considered a necessary or luxury item. The tax rate for basic necessities is 1%, the tax rate for luxury items is 9%. For simplicity of implementation, all transactions are measured in cents (pennies).
